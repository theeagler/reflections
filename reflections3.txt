When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to create a remote repository for different reasons. One being that you can have other collaborate on the same project and push the online repository. Also, this may be a good feature if you are working on multiple computers throughtout the day.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to interject new code from the remote onto your computer, there may be contributions that you aren't ready to apply to your current state on the computer.
