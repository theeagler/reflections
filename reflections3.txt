When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to create a remote repository for different reasons. One being that you can have other collaborate on the same project and push the online repository. Also, this may be a good feature if you are working on multiple computers throughtout the day.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might not want to interject new code from the remote onto your computer, there may be contributions that you aren't ready to apply to your current state on the computer.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Clones copy files and commits directly to your computer, this is great for working offline. Forks allow you to copy a repository onto your personal git page that allow you to independently explore someone elses work whilst giving them credit and not altering the original commits. Branching allows you to deviate from the master branch in order to experiment with new features.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare changes made on the online repository with those made last on your local computer.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git and github, comparing and collaborating with others would be a tedious task of checking code line by line. I imagine multiple files would need to be created and cataloged to keep up with changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Creating branches allows you to explore and experiment with something that you have already functioning in master. Branches are important because they allow you the flexibility to tinker.
